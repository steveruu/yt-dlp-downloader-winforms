# yt-dlp-downloader-winforms
a downloader made for yt-dlp built in c# that uses the winforms library or sum idk  

## prerequisites:
- **yt-dlp.exe**
- **maybe** ffmpeg (idk)  
- windows >= **10** (8.1 isn't tested)  
- brain   

## recommendations:
- put the yt-dlp.exe file into c:\windows\system32, or you'll have to rewrite the path every time you start the program cuz i don't know how to save configs yet lol  
- try not to break the thing, it isn't faultproof at all, but it's built for basic usage, that's why the program is so small  

## advisory:
- this program was made for fun by a computer science student  
- report any issues

## jestli tohle cte mthia:
- nemusis ani rikat, ze je vsechno spatne a nefunkcni, C# se ucim tak tejden a winforms jsem jel podle nejakyho 9miuntovyho indickyho tutorialu ale budu otevrenej konstruktivni kritice dekuju cau
- napsal jsem to asi tak za hodinu
