## 📝 prerequisites:
- **yt-dlp.exe**
- **maybe** ffmpeg (idk)  
- windows >= **10** (8.1 isn't tested)  
- brain   

## 🥺 recommendations:
- put the yt-dlp.exe file into c:\windows\system32, or you'll have to rewrite the path every time you start the program cuz i don't know how to save configs yet lol  
- try not to break the thing, it isn't faultproof at all, but it's built for basic usage, that's why the program is so small  

## 💙 advisory:
- this program was made for fun by a computer science student  
- report any issues
